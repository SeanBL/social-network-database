 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build a social networking database in MongoDB and use Mongoose as an ORM. The motivation behind this project was to familiarize myself with a NoSql database which is quite common in the creation of many web applications. This project has taught me how to construct a basic social networking database structure which allows users to store login information, their thoughts as posts, reactions to other posts, and the number of friends they've added. These are some of the basic functions for many web applications which will prepare for future jobs.
